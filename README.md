# NimScan
Port Scanner built with Nim


This is a quick & dirty port scanner I "whipped up" to learn more about the Nim programming language.

+ Installation
====
  - Clone the repo
    + `git clone 

It's pretty straight forward, and has 2 modes of operation...

1. *Command-Line Mode*
2. *Interactive Mode*

+ Command-Line Mode
====
  - You pass all the parameters to nimscan
